<h1>Remote Desktop Connection</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this scenario, I'll connect to John's PC remotely using the Helpdesk account. This prevents me from accessing John's account, but it does allow me to login to his PC. Even if I am unable to remote access John's account, his files and folders remain accessible. That is because the PC he is using has locally saved his account's files and folders, allowing me to access them remotely.</p>
